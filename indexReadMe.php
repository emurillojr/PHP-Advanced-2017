        <p>Create an index page that will display all the results in the table. 
           Create an add page that will allow the user to add a new record. 
           Please validate the fields using PHP or Regex where it makes sense. 
           Use a ZIP code regex for ZIP(5 numbers only). For Birthday just check that is is a valid date(regex or PHP). 
           If the user does not enter data or if the data is not valid. 
           You do not need a Regex for fullname, addressline1, state or city. 
           Display a list of errors for each field that does not validate. 
           Re-populate the post values back into the fields that the user has entered data for when the data is invalid.
           Display a success message if the user is able to add the data. 
           Make sure to have links on the site to navigate to the index and add page. (5 points)</p>
